Two trucks having sex

Two trucks having sex

My muscles, my muscles

Involuntarily flex

Two trucks having sex

Two trucks having sex

My muscles, my muscles

Involuntarily flex

Two pickup trucks

Making love

American made

Built Ford tough

Two beautiful murder machines

American angels in the sky

Grown men cry

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

My muscles (oh), my muscles (oh)

Involuntarily flex

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)

Involuntarily flex

Right by my side

There's zz top

And PLAYERNAME

From maniac cop one, two and three

This barbecue could bring you to your knees

And so could these two trucks

Two trucks holding hands

Two trucks holding hands

The passion, the passion

Is more than I can withstand

Two trucks holding hands

Two trucks holding hands

The passion, the passion

My big fat heart expands

Two pickup trucks

One cylinder block

Crush my body like a rock

So beautiful

No stars tonight

Just fireworks, eagles and PLAYERNAME in the sky

The founding fathers cry

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)

Involuntarily flex

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

Two trucks having sex (oh yes)

My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)

Involuntarily flex

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah-ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ah

Two trucks having sex

Two trucks having sex

My muscles, my muscles

Involuntarily flex

Two trucks having sex

Two trucks having sex

My muscles, my muscles

Involuntarily flex

Two trucks (having sex)

Two trucks (having sex)

Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)

Two trucks (having sex)

Two trucks (having sex)

Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)
